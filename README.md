This repository contains Python code for the MICCAI 2020 paper 

*A Kernelized Multi-level Localization Method for Flexible Shape Modeling with Few Training Data*
by Matthias Wilms, Jan Ehrhardt, Nils D. Forkert (see https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59719-1_74)

This code is a Python-based extension of the MATLAB codebase we created for our Medical Image Analysis paper from 2017 (see https://imi.uni-luebeck.de/multi-resolution-multi-object-statistical-shape-models)

See demo_miccai.py as a starting point. If you want to replicate our results (small-scale; see paper), you first need to obtain the SCR/JSRT data. See the MATLAB code from our MedIA paper on how to obtain and convert that data set.
